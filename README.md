# Meshless and X-FEM methods combination
Meshless and X-FEM methods were combined to solve 2D problem of fracture mechanics. The goal of this thesis is to create a new kind of mathematical and numerical model to calculate fatigue centre crack propagation in 2D plate under mixed mode. Moreover, its advantages in comparison with ANSYS are proved by numerical experiments.
